# Hi, I'm Ana 💻

**Data Scientist @ The HEINEKEN Company · Brazil**

I work in the Supply Chain Data Science tower, supporting one of the largest Heineken operations in the world — covering the entire Brazilian territory. My projects go from conception to production: I own the full lifecycle, from ideation and modeling to deployment and CI/CD pipeline integration, working closely with Engineering, MLOps, and DevOps teams.

My core focus is **inventory optimization** — finished goods, raw materials, and inputs — delivering multi-million BRL savings per year to the business. I work in Scrum, and every solution I ship is designed with performance, cost-efficiency, and long-term maintainability in mind.

My background bridges **Mechanical Engineering** (UTFPR) and **Data Engineering** (XP Educação), which means I understand the industrial domain behind the data — and I care about models that work in the real world, not just in notebooks.
